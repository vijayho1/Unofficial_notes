Main funtionality:
                A complete end-to-end portal for students to get notes,help in navigation/explore and also chat and share their thoughts with a explicit chat detection function

Roadmap(for login credentials):

                        first phase:
                                    integrate mongodb (done)
                                    send email's from a custom emailId (done)
                                    have a otp funtionality (done)
                                    add a password reset funtionality(gonna complete by 22 dec)
                                    add some customization and other texts in the otp email sent 
                                    start making terms and condition page where people can see the rules etc
                                    so like if the person verifies the otp it should be like they accept the terms and conditions!!

                                                 And then have a dynamic api pulling where we can show out the folders as required on the basis of unit and then chapters
                                                 also have other extra folders where we can have lessonplan,modelqp's and pyq's all in a single folder!!

Roadmap for navigation:

        phase 1:
                get the data:
                            #)class numbers:
                                            with the details of whats actually done in the class like main 
                                            funtionality
                                            like its for c programming class,dtsi,pc or other stuffs in the different branch buildings 
                            #)washrooms:
                                        here we would have the places of washroom in each floor and each building 
                                        and also a pic of the godamn place from the common pov

                            #)Teachers cabin's location
                                        we would locate each lecturer's cabin and the floor the place where they usually sit 
        
        phase 2:
                create a good looking map:
                                        how?
                                            take a ss of the building from the google maps if possible 
                                            or take a blueprint photo
                                            and then add pointers to them etc
        
        phase 3:
                create an api of the info got

        phase 4:
                integrate the api with a local run ai 
                which provides quick info for where to go to reach the destination
        
Roadmap for chat system:

        phase 1:                
                                        soo it needs to have a explicit words detection and clear guidelines 
                                        and strict imposition of banning people and all

                        design idea:
                                    like reddit!
                                                where people could post a thread and keep commenting on it 
                                                also maintain the post reputation
