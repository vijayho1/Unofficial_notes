                                                            lesson plans
                                                            model qp's
                                                            last year paper's
                                                            class test question's
                                                            curated yt channel names for each subject

I can do that or just make like drop down boxes for branch,sem,subject 
and then load another webpage which matches all the selected values and then show another page where they can choose the options in a lesson which are in forms of box templates and after selection they would get all the resources which they can download or view 

i have to decide which side should i take
