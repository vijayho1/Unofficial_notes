Originally planned as a simple notes portal, this project has now expanded into a multi-functional student utility hub based on feedback from friends, family, and research. The goal is to build a platform that helps students with academics, navigation, and campus life.


Planned Features
- Notes Repository
- Curated notes for each semester and branch.
- Start with CSE notes, then expand with contributions from other students.
- CGPA Calculator
- Quick version: students input subjects, credits, and marks → rough CGPA.
- Advanced version: auto-fetch evaluation schemes from lesson plans for more accuracy.
- Campus Navigation
- Interactive map with pins for major buildings, labs, library, canteen, and washrooms.
- Faculty info: staffroom locations, photos, and typical availability.
- Timetable integration to avoid disturbing teachers during class hours.
- Feedback & Legal Layer
- Footer with Terms & Conditions and disclaimers (students must verify info).
- Option to mail/report corrections or updates.


Development Strategy
We’ll build the project in layers, ensuring each module is stable before moving on.
Phase 1: Authentication
- Secure login page.
- Access restricted to KLE IDs.
- OTP verification for first-time login and password resets.
Phase 2: Notes Portal
- Launch with CSE notes.
- Expand to other branches via student contributions.
Phase 3: CGPA Calculator
- Quick version (≈1 week): manual input of credits and marks.
- Advanced version (longer): automated mapping from lesson plans.
Phase 4: Campus Navigation
- Map design + coding (≈1 week).
- Survey and data collection (≈1 month, faster with student help).
Phase 5: Legal & Feedback
- Add disclaimers, footer, and feedback system.
- Display “last updated” timestamps for transparency.


Timeline (Tentative)
- December: Authentication + CSE notes portal.
- January: Quick CGPA calculator.
- Feb–Mar: Expand notes + begin navigation survey.
- March–April: Faculty info + advanced CGPA calculator.
- Ongoing: Feedback loop, UI polish, and scaling.
